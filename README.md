# 100-days-of-python-projects

This repository tracks my progress in the "100 Days of Python Code" challenge. Over the course of 100 days, my focus will be on actively learning and practicing Python programming, accomplishing coding exercises, and constructing a range of projects to elevate my Python skills. Throughout this challenge, I will explore and delve into different Python concepts, continually expanding my understanding. As I make progress in the course, I will include the respective project links to showcase my development.

## Accessing Projects
To access and explore each project, follow the provided links and initiate their execution. Once the project is opened, make sure to click the "Run" button and input the required data as instructed. This will enable you to proceed, gain a deeper understanding of the project, and discover its functionalities.

## Project Progression
The projects progress from basic to more advanced as you move forward. Initially, you will encounter simpler projects that lay a foundation in Python programming. As you continue, the projects gradually become more complex, allowing you to delve into advanced concepts and challenges.

## Progressive Skill Development
This progressive approach ensures a gradual and comprehensive development of my Python skills over time. By systematically building upon my knowledge and experience, I gain a deep understanding of the language. Hands-on projects and practical application further enhance my proficiency and provide valuable insights into Python's intricacies.

This project is designed to help you create a secure and random password. It will prompt you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password. Based on this information, the project will generate a complete random password for you.
By using this project, you can ensure that your password is secure and difficult for hackers to target. It's an effective way to generate strong passwords and enhance your online security. Stay safe!

### Day 6 Project: Reebord's World/ Maze escape 
Link: pending

Get ready for a maze-tastic adventure with Reeborg! Our character's on a mission to break free from the puzzling maze. But oh no, there's a sneaky bug in the mix! So until I ace day 15, this project's on hold, but watch out for our epic maze escape soon! Stay tuned!


### Day 7 Project: Hangman
